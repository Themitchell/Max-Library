# Max Library

This is my personal Library of Max patches and externals I use.

Items in the Max for Live directory are works in progress which will eventually be moved into my Ableton Live library.

Folder Hierarchy*:

* Collections - Full blown patches containing everything required to run a patch including samples, xml etc
* Library - default max directory. Not sure what goes here
* Max for Live Devices - Self explanatory, these will be moved to my Ableton Live library as they become useable
* Old Externals - Old externals kept around for brevity
* Packages - Equivalent of the old externals directory and kept in the load path
* Projects - This is where my custom projects go
* snippets - Partials for reuse in other patches

*NB: The hierarchy here is mostly a guide. Not all files are in the correct location.
