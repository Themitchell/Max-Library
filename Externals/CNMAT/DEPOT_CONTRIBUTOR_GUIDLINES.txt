Below is a list of guidlines that should be followed by individuals wishing to contribute to CNMAT's Max/MSP/Jitter Depot.

--Filenames
	Avoid the use of all non-alpha-numeric characters except for . _ - (period, underscore, dash).  Also avoid the use of spaces in filenames--use an underscore instead.  Remember that certain non-alpha-numeric characters such as '+' are harmless on Mac OS X, but wreak havoc on Windows systems.  In the past, '+' has been used at the beginning of a file name to force the Finder to list it at the top of the list--if you want this, use an underscore instead.  Never, under any circumstances, use Unix wildcard or special characters lke *$#@ or the directory separator / (\ on windows).

	Filenames should be chosen to communicate clearly to the user what it is that the file does.  Long filenames are fine as long as they are less than 32 characters (this has been a problem in the past although it may not be in the future).

	Avoid filenames that use a special character to get the Finder to list a file at the top of a folder.  There are a number of reasons this should be avoided:  If there is a 'main' file in a folder, its importance should be communicated to the user through a carefully chosen filename, not by attempting to get it to rise to the top of the list.  Furthermore, this trick yields inconsistent results: it only works in one of the three finder views, it doesn't necessarily work in the terminal (depending on the character used), it may or may not work on Windows, etc.

	
--Help files
	All contributions to the depot _must_ have a helpfile that clearly demonstrates the functionality of the object/abstraction that it goes with.  
	
	Wherever possible, use standard Max objects in helpfiles to avoid unnecessary dependencies.

--Deprecation
	Occasionally a piece of code (object, patch, abstraction, etc.) becomes obsolete.  When this happens, the patch should be moved into the Deprecated directory and it should be modified so that when instantiated, it prints a message to the Max window stating that the object has become deprecated and will be removed at some date in the future.  It should also tell the user what object to use instead.  Once a reasonable amount of time has passed, the object should be moved to /cnmat/trunk/max/patches/MMJ-Depot/Deprecated where it will no longer be released with the Depot.

--Dependencies
	Make sure that all dependencies are actually in the Depot.  There is a folder called media that has sound files that can be used in Depot helpfiles.
