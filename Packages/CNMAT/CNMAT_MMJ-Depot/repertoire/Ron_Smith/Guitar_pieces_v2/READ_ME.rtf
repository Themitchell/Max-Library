\
The Max/MSP patch:\
\
1)  Download and install the CNMAT externals package for your platform (http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/downloads) and place it in an appropriate folder on your hard drive.\
\
2)  If you own Max/MSP, open the Max/MSP file "
\f1 top-level_guitar_pieces.maxpat".  This is the main patch for the piece.
\f0   If you don't own Max/MSP, open the file 5_Pieces_for_Guitar_standalone.\
\
===========================\
\
Audio:\
\
Use your usual audio interface with your computer.  You will need to use a microphone on your guitar to bring audio into the Max/MSP patch.\
\
Send audio out of your computer using the same audio interface.  Send the audio output to stereo loudspeakers.\
\

\
MIDI foot switch.\
\
You will need a MIDI foot switch (controller number 64) to control the program changes.  It needs to send out 
\b controller number 64
\b0  (this is the same device that is used as a sustain pedal used on MIDI keyboards).  Bring the MIDI into the computer with a MIDI interface.\
\
If you are using a MOTU 828 or something similar with a "punch in" port to bring in the foot switch data, then set the pedal down with "b" and the pedal up with "u" in the MOTU Audio set up window.\
